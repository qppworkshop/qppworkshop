          This workshop holds a steadfast commitment to fostering collaboration among researchers engaged
          in the realm of knowledge integration for IR, RecSys and NLP. We invite submissions regarding different
          aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval systems. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul class="large text-muted">
          <ul>
            <li>Knowledge-enhanced information retrieval models. </li>
            <li>Knowledge-enhanced approaches for query processing, including query parsing, query expansion,
              relevance feedback, and query reformulation. </li>
            <li>Knowledge-enhanced recommendation models. </li>
            <li>Knowledge-enhanced language models for retrieval. </li>
            <li>Data augmentation for knowledge-enhanced information retrieval. </li>
            <li>Knowledge retrieval from unstructured data and structured data. </li>
            <li>Applications of knowledge-enhanced retrievals, such as dialogue systems, question answering,
              summarisation and other domain-specific applications.</li>
            <li>Data collection for knowledge-enhanced information retrieval.</li>
            <li>Evaluation methodologies for knowledge-enhanced retrieval.</li>
            <li>The interpretability and analysis of knowledge-enhanced models for IR, including potential biases and
              ethical considerations.</li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

          We invite authors to submit papers written in English. Submissions may range in length from a minimum of 6
          pages to a maximum of 12 pages; however, references and supplementary materials may exceed this page count
          without limitation. In order to facilitate a double-blind review process, authors must ensure that submissions
          are fully anonymized. Please note that we do not impose a specific anonymity period prior to submission.

          </br> </br>
          The papers (.pdf format) should be submitted using the EasyChair submission system at <a
            href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=keirecir2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=keirecir2024</a>.
          Authors should consult Springer’s authors’
          guidelines and use their proceedings templates to prepare the submission. The Microsoft Word and LaTeX
          versions of the template can be found at <a
            href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines</a>.
          Submissions to
          KEIR@ECIR2024 will be peer-reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance to workshop topics,
          originality, significance, clarity, etc.
          </br>

          We accept submissions of the following types:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Original work that is not published or submitted elsewhere.</li>
          <li>Work that is submitted elsewhere and is still under review. In this case, the authors should make sure
            that you are not violating the submission guidelines and anonymity requirements of the other venue(s).
          </li>
          <li>Work that has been rejected at ECIR 2024.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <p class="large text-muted">
          The proceedings of the KEIR workshop will be non-archival in nature. Extended versions of selected papers will
          be recommended for special issues of several SCI-indexed international journals. However, authors retain the
          right to submit their work to other peer-reviewed venues for further dissemination.
