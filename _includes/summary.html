<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Query performance prediction (QPP), a.k.a. query difficulty prediction, is a key task in information retrieval (IR). QPP has been studied for decades in the IR community. The task of QPP is defined as estimating search effectiveness without human relevance judgments. <br>
<br>
We are excited to announce the <b>QPP++ 2025</b> workshop, titled "<b>Query Performance Prediction and its Applications in the Era of Large Language Models</b>," co-located with the 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2025), from 6th to 10th April 2025 in Lucca, Italy. <br>
<br>
In this workshop, we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss new perspectives on QPP in the era of large language models (LLMs). QPP++ 2025 is the continuation of the <a href="https://qpp.dei.unipd.it/"><span class="s2">QPP++ 2023</span></a> workshop held in ECIR 2023.</span></p>
