                    Query performance prediction (QPP), a.k.a. query difficulty prediction, is a key task in information retrieval (IR).
                    The task of QPP is defined as estimating search effectiveness without human relevance judgments.
                    Effective QPP benefits various tasks, e.g., query variant selection [30], selective query expansion, ranker selection, or query-specific pool depth prediction to reduce human relevance judgment costs in collection construction.
