                    Query performance prediction (QPP), a.k.a. query difficulty prediction, is a key task in information retrieval (IR).
                    QPP has been studied for decades in the IR community.
                    The task of QPP is defined as estimating search effectiveness without human relevance judgments.

                    In this workshop (QPP++ 2025), we aim to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss new perspectives on QPP in the era of large language models (LLMs).
                    QPP++ 2025 is the continuation of the <a href="https://qpp.dei.unipd.it/">QPP++ 2023</a> workshop held in ECIR 2023.
