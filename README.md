## KEIR@ECIR 2024: The First Workshop on Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval


## Summary

Pretrained language models (PLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT4 are reshaping the AI domains such as in information retrieval and recommendation systems. Knowledge graphs enhance PLMs by incorporating external knowledge. Despite advancements, current information retrieval systems struggle with semantic nuances, context relevance, and domain-specific issues.  To bridge these gaps, we propose the Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2024) as a platform to discuss innovative approaches that integrate external knowledge, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval, including models, techniques, data collection and evaluation.
