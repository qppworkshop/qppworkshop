content-speak: At Bloomberg, we build search applications for financial professionals as a part of our main product, the Bloomberg Terminal. In this talk, we will provide an illustration of a typical search workflow at Bloomberg, and discuss 1) how structured and encoded knowledge could be utilized end-to-end in a search system, and 2) challenges in applying them effectively at each step. Early in the pipeline, knowledge can be used to enrich and organize documents in the searchable collection. Thus, we start by discussing the document understanding step. Then, we consider the challenges of interpreting queries correctly and applying the appropriate retrieval configuration needed to satisfy the userâ€™s information needs. We then continue to discuss the utilization of such enriched knowledge for document retrieval and reranking. Lastly, since user experience (UX) plays an important role in the search process, we will also discuss open questions around designing the user experience that is guided by knowledge.
