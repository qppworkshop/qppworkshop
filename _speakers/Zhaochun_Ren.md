content-speak: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have revolutionized how we interact with the recommender by discerning user preferences through iterative dialogues. However, the effectiveness of these systems is often hindered by a need for more contextual understanding for precise preference modeling. Integrating various external knowledge sources offers promising solutions to enrich dialogue context, predict user preferences, and generate informative responses. This presentation will delve into recent advancements in the realm of knowledge-enhanced CRS, spotlighting studies that leverage knowledge to refine recommendations and enrich user interactions. I will share insights from our recent research that bolsters the recommendation quality and the informativeness of conversational responses. Additionally, I will illuminate emerging research trajectories within this domain, emphasizing the synergy between CRS and Large Language Models.
